# Back-end
Some documentation for front-end devs
_VERY IMPORTANT_: for development reasons, we use a local connection to the database, to toggle the connection to a hosted databse, do the following:
1. go to `app-server/models/index.js`.
2. in the line _6_, you will find that `process.env.MONGODB_URI` is commented, **_UNCOMMENT_** it

## Models / Routes
_Note_: The javascript included is going to contain the properties and an example of data.
### User:
+ **Properties preceded by a:**
	1. _' - '_ are required to sign up a user.

### Zone:

+ **Properties preceded by a:**
	1. _' - '_ are required to Create a Zone.
	```javascript

		/* - */latitude: 45,
		/* - */wilaya: "Algiers",
		/* - */risk_state: "Medium",
		medical_etablissement: [ObjectId]

	| METHOD | ROUTE | DESCRIPTION | RESULT |
	|:--------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
	| GET | /api/zones/:user_id | Get all Zones |Array of Zones: `[ {longitude, latitude, wilaya, risk_state} ]`|

**Note**: Not anyone can create a Zone, only users with _admin_ roles have access to such a thing, that's why we specify the user_id in the route, and to ensure authorization, in the header the followed property must be available while fetching:
```javascript
{
	header: {
		"authorization": "Bearer <token of currentUser>"
	}
}
```
